                  <p>Beyond being a student, I am a stay-at-home-mother of two kiddos that have just started to go school full time. Though my children in school full time now, that does not mean that my work is done. I still take care of all the meals, laundry, taking care of pets, cleaning around the house, etc. Being a mother is not an easy task and those that think it is obviously do not take care of children twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.</p>
                  <p>I am also the caretaker to my mother since she has gone through breast cancer treatment. Though, her treatment is over, I still help her do a lot of things in her own home as well as outside of it (IE, shopping for groceries, etc). It takes a lot of my mother still to do some things around the house, but I do my best to help her while my kiddos are in school and a little bit after.</p>

                     <p>In my spare I do my best to make stock to sell at local craft fairs or online. Although, I have the makings of getting my own Etsy store up and running. With my other daily tasks of being a mother/homemaker/caretaker, my own creations fall to the way side. I do hope to have something up and running in the near future!</p>

                        <p>I was a licensed massage and bodywork therapist for ten years and it was an enlightening experience. As a LMBT I worked mainly the spa sector of the field, but I also have experience of working in the medical clincical side. Both sectors require the massage therapist to use SOAP notes after each session for the client's use for insurance purposes, the doctor's refernce (if needed), and (most of all) to keep a record for ourselves (the massage therpaist) to see how the treatment is helping the client progress in their healthcare needs. This is just a tidbit of what a massage therapist does.</p>
